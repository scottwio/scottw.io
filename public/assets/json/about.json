  "description": "Iâ€™m a front-end developer and a self-confessed code and design geek. I discovered my passion for technology and design at a young age. While learning the skills to become a web designer, I became obsessed with the web technologies. I grabbed some books and taught myself how to code HTML and, well, the rest is history. These days you can find me honing my Javascript skills and learning whatever the latest hot framework or library currently is.",
